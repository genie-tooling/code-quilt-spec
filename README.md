## Introduction: Researching LLMs in Data Pipelines

`genie-tooling` is a project dedicated to researching and exploring effective ways to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) within data pipelines and complex workflows. Our focus includes interactions with various models (including local models via Ollama), developing agentic AI systems, improving reasoning pipelines, and enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of LLM integrations.

One key challenge identified in this research is ensuring the reliability of dynamic code generation, a common task in automated pipelines. This led to the development of the **CodeQuilt** specification.

## The Challenge: Reliable Code Generation with LLMs

While LLMs are powerful code generators, they can sometimes fail unpredictably, particularly by truncating output before completion. This is often due to inherent limitations like maximum output token lengths. In automated systems (like data pipelines or agentic workflows), such failures can lead to broken processes, wasted computational resources, and increased operational costs.

## The CodeQuilt Specification (v0.2.0): A Proposed Solution

CodeQuilt is a specification developed within `genie-tooling` for representing source code in a highly compressed, text-based format. It acts as a textual "blueprint" generated *before* the full code (or instead of, as you prefer to reduce output length and context), designed to capture the complete essence of the intended code reliably.

**Purpose:** The primary goal of CodeQuilt is to improve the *probability of receiving a complete representation* of the LLM's intended code output, working around common limitations.

## Benefits in Modern LLM Environments

Employing a CodeQuilt-based approach offers several potential advantages in the context of current LLM constraints, APIs, and costs:

* **Mitigating Output Token Limits:** Generating a compact CodeQuilt string first is significantly less likely to hit maximum output token limits compared to generating potentially lengthy source code directly. This increases the chance of receiving a *usable* output even if the subsequent full code generation gets truncated.
* **Cost Efficiency & API Usage:**
    * *Reduced Retries:* Fewer truncated or incomplete code generations can mean fewer wasted API calls and less need for costly retries.
    * *Potentially Lower Cost-per-Success:* While CodeQuilt involves a two-stage generation, the first stage (generating the short CodeQuilt string) consumes very few tokens. If the second stage (full code) fails, the cost incurred is often less than a single, long, failed generation attempt. This can lead to a lower average cost *per successfully generated, complete code block*.
    * *Efficient Reconstruction Input:* If reconstruction requires calling an LLM, the small CodeQuilt string serves as concise, efficient input, consuming fewer input tokens than feeding back potentially large amounts of broken or truncated code.
* **Increased Reliability for Automation:** For data pipelines or agentic systems relying on generated code, using CodeQuilt can enhance robustness by providing a fallback mechanism, reducing the likelihood of workflow failure due to incomplete code generation.
* **Working Within Context Windows:** The small size of CodeQuilt helps manage limited context windows, both for the initial output and for potential reconstruction or analysis tasks.

## Intended Usage in an LLM Pipeline

The envisioned workflow leverages these benefits:

1.  **Stage 1: CodeQuilt Generation:** The LLM first generates the compact CodeQuilt string representing the planned code. Due to its small size, this is likely to complete successfully and cost-effectively.
2.  **Stage 2: Full Code Generation:** The LLM then attempts to generate the standard, full source code.
3.  **Fallback/Reconstruction:** If Stage 2 output is incomplete or fails, the CodeQuilt string from Stage 1 provides a reliable blueprint for reconstruction, minimizing data loss and potentially reducing the cost and complexity of error handling.

## Key Features of CodeQuilt v0.2.0

* **Header Metadata:** Includes language info, identifier mappings (`dict`), optional literal mappings (`lit_dict`), and options. Three verbosity levels offer flexibility.
* **Compressed Body:** Uses short tokens for keywords, operators, and structure, referencing dictionaries for identifiers and literals.
* **Structure Representation:** Explicit tokens handle newlines and indentation (`N`, `I+`, `I-`, `{`, `}`).
* **Embedded Code Handling:** Specifies treating embedded languages (SQL, HTML, etc.) as opaque string literals (using `lit_dict` for larger blocks) to preserve them accurately.
* **Escape Hatch `L{...}`:** Provides a robust fallback for complex or unique host language syntax.
